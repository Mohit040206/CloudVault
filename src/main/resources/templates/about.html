    <h2>The Idea Behind CloudVault</h2>
    <p>
      The inspiration for CloudVault came during our very first year of college.
      Four of us – <strong>me, Amit, Priyanshu, and Sumaskant</strong> – dreamed of creating a place
      where we could store and relive our golden college memories together.
      Not just documents, but also <strong>photos and videos of our college life</strong>,
      safely stored in one platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our vision was simple yet powerful: instead of public shareable links,
      access would be controlled through <strong>IDs and passwords</strong>.
      That way, only the people who truly shared those memories could upload,
      view, and download them — making it feel more personal, more private,
      and more connected.
    </p>
    <p>
      What began as a casual discussion among friends has now taken shape
      as <strong>CloudVault</strong> — a project built with Java and Spring Boot,
      starting with document storage but with the future goal of expanding
      to images and videos that can be <strong>viewed and played directly inside the platform</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Future & Scope</h2>
    <p>
      While currently focused on secure document management, CloudVault aims to expand
      into supporting media files such as photos and videos. The long-term vision
      is to create a personal digital memory space where users can preserve and
      relive their journeys with friends, family, and colleagues.
